# Face and Hand Mark Detection

# Overview

This project detects facial and hand landmarks in real-time using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It utilizes the MediaPipe Holistic model to track facial features and hand movements efficiently.

# Features

Real-time face landmark detection

Hand landmark detection (both left and right hands)

FPS (Frames Per Second) display for performance monitoring
